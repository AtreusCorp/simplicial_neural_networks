# Simplicial Neural Networks

Stefania Ebli, MichaÃ«l Defferrard and Gard Spreemann

The code in this repository implements Simplicial Neural Networks (SNNs) a generalization of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to data that live on a class of topological spaces called [simplicial complexes]. These are natural multi-dimensional extensions of graphs that encode not only pairwise relationships but also higher-order interactions between vertices---allowing us to consider richer data, including vector fields and n-fold collaboration networks. We define an appropriate notion of convolution that we leverage to construct the desired convolutional neural networks.The code for SNNs has been implemented in [PyTorch]
